**Angular Frontend Summary**

**Highlights**
- Productive scaffolding with `@angular/cli` and clear project layout.
- Simple routing set up in `AppRoutingModule` with clean redirects.
- Reactive Forms make validation straightforward in `LoginComponent` and `RegisterComponent`.
- `HttpClient` + interceptor centralize `withCredentials` handling for cookie auth.
- TailwindCSS integration via PostCSS is minimal and works well for quick styling.
- Dev proxy (`proxy.conf.json`) + `environment.apiBaseUrl` keep API calls ergonomic during dev.

**Challenges**
- Some ceremony (modules/providers) compared to standalone APIs; adds boilerplate for a small app.
- Reactive Forms typing can be a bit verbose; non‑null assertions creep in on submit.
- Cross‑origin cookies require careful alignment of `withCredentials`, proxy paths, and backend CORS.
- Error surfacing in templates is slightly chatty without shared UI helpers/toasts.

**Runtime**
- Dev server is responsive with fast rebuilds for template + style edits.
- Form validation is instant; HTTP flows are simple and predictable.
- Interceptor adds negligible overhead while improving consistency.

**Dev Notes**
- Key pieces: `AuthService` (login/register), `AuthInterceptor` (cookies), `Login/Register` pages, router.
- Uses `environment.apiBaseUrl = '/api'` with `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json` for local dev.
- In production, point `apiBaseUrl` to the real origin or keep server‑side relative paths.
- Ensure backend sets cookies with correct `SameSite` and `Secure` attributes for cross‑site flows.

**Bottom Line**
- Angular provides a solid, batteries‑included front‑end for this benchmark: routing, forms, DI, and HTTP are cohesive and quick to wire. For tiny surfaces it’s a touch verbose, but the structure pays off as features grow.
