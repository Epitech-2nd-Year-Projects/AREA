## type [Executor](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/adapters/outbound/reaction/http/executor.go#L20-L23>)

Executor delivers reaction payloads over HTTP according to reaction configuration

```go
type Executor struct {
    Client *http.Client
    Logger *zap.Logger
}
```

<a name="Executor.Execute"></a>
### func \(Executor\) [Execute](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/adapters/outbound/reaction/http/executor.go#L35>)

```go
func (e Executor) Execute(ctx context.Context, area areadomain.Area, link areadomain.Link) (outbound.ReactionResult, error)
```

Execute dispatches the reaction for supported components

<a name="Executor.ExecuteReaction"></a>
### func \(Executor\) [ExecuteReaction](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/adapters/outbound/reaction/http/executor.go#L40>)

```go
func (e Executor) ExecuteReaction(ctx context.Context, area areadomain.Area, link areadomain.Link) (outbound.ReactionResult, error)
```

ExecuteReaction sends an HTTP request when the reaction component is supported

<a name="Executor.Supports"></a>
### func \(Executor\) [Supports](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/adapters/outbound/reaction/http/executor.go#L26>)

```go
func (e Executor) Supports(component *componentdomain.Component) bool
```

Supports reports whether the executor can handle the provided component
