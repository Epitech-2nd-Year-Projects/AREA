<a name="DedupStatus"></a>
## type [DedupStatus](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/event.go#L10>)

DedupStatus mirrors the dedup\_status enum in the database

```go
type DedupStatus string
```

<a name="DedupStatusNew"></a>

```go
const (
    // DedupStatusNew marks events that have not been processed yet
    DedupStatusNew DedupStatus = "new"
    // DedupStatusDuplicate marks events that were ignored because they were seen before
    DedupStatusDuplicate DedupStatus = "duplicate"
    // DedupStatusIgnored marks events skipped by upstream filters
    DedupStatusIgnored DedupStatus = "ignored"
)
```

<a name="Event"></a>
## type [Event](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/event.go#L22-L30>)

Event captures an incoming action occurrence recorded from an action source

```go
type Event struct {
    ID          uuid.UUID
    SourceID    uuid.UUID
    OccurredAt  time.Time
    ReceivedAt  time.Time
    Fingerprint string
    Payload     map[string]any
    DedupStatus DedupStatus
}
```

<a name="Mode"></a>
## type [Mode](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/source.go#L11>)

Mode enumerates action source execution strategies

```go
type Mode string
```

<a name="ModeWebhook"></a>

```go
const (
    // ModeWebhook is used for webhook-driven actions
    ModeWebhook Mode = "webhook"
    // ModePolling is used for polling actions
    ModePolling Mode = "polling"
    // ModeSchedule is used for scheduled actions
    ModeSchedule Mode = "schedule"
)
```

<a name="PollingBinding"></a>
## type [PollingBinding](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/source.go#L47-L54>)

PollingBinding associates a polling action source with its AREA metadata

```go
type PollingBinding struct {
    Source     Source
    AreaID     uuid.UUID
    AreaLinkID uuid.UUID
    UserID     uuid.UUID
    NextRun    time.Time
    Config     componentdomain.Config
}
```

<a name="ScheduleBinding"></a>
## type [ScheduleBinding](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/source.go#L37-L44>)

ScheduleBinding associates a scheduled action source with its AREA metadata

```go
type ScheduleBinding struct {
    Source     Source
    AreaID     uuid.UUID
    AreaLinkID uuid.UUID
    UserID     uuid.UUID
    NextRun    time.Time
    Config     componentdomain.Config
}
```

<a name="Source"></a>
## type [Source](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/source.go#L23-L34>)

Source models the persistence layer representation of an action source

```go
type Source struct {
    ID                uuid.UUID
    ComponentConfigID uuid.UUID
    Mode              Mode
    Cursor            map[string]any
    WebhookSecret     *string
    WebhookURLPath    *string
    Schedule          *string
    IsActive          bool
    CreatedAt         time.Time
    UpdatedAt         time.Time
}
```

<a name="Trigger"></a>
## type [Trigger](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/trigger.go#L24-L32>)

Trigger ties an action event to a concrete AREA

```go
type Trigger struct {
    ID        uuid.UUID
    EventID   uuid.UUID
    AreaID    uuid.UUID
    Status    TriggerStatus
    MatchInfo map[string]any
    CreatedAt time.Time
    UpdatedAt time.Time
}
```

<a name="TriggerStatus"></a>
## type [TriggerStatus](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/trigger.go#L10>)

TriggerStatus mirrors the trigger\_status enum in the database

```go
type TriggerStatus string
```

<a name="TriggerStatusPending"></a>

```go
const (
    // TriggerStatusPending indicates that conditions have not been evaluated yet
    TriggerStatusPending TriggerStatus = "pending"
    // TriggerStatusMatched indicates that the trigger matched the automation conditions
    TriggerStatusMatched TriggerStatus = "matched"
    // TriggerStatusFiltered indicates that the trigger was filtered out by conditions
    TriggerStatusFiltered TriggerStatus = "filtered"
    // TriggerStatusFailed indicates that evaluation failed
    TriggerStatusFailed TriggerStatus = "failed"
)
```

<a name="WebhookBinding"></a>
## type [WebhookBinding](<https://github.com/Epitech-2nd-Year-Projects/AREA/blob/main/server/internal/domain/action/source.go#L57-L62>)

WebhookBinding associates a webhook action source with its AREA metadata

```go
type WebhookBinding struct {
    Source     Source
    AreaID     uuid.UUID
    AreaLinkID uuid.UUID
    UserID     uuid.UUID
}
```
